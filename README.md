# Pokémon Battle React Project
This project is a small React application developed as a challenge for the Software Engineering course at the Center for Informatics (CIn) of the Federal University of Pernambuco. The primary objective is to make requests to a Pokémon API and, using the information returned (such as the Pokémon's name, type, HP, attack, defense, etc.), implement a simple logic for a battle between two Pokémon. Additionally, the project displays the initial 20 Pokémon from the API as a user's Pokédex, showing only their names and images.

## Features
* **Pokémon API Integration**: Fetches Pokémon data from the Pokémon API.
* **Battle Logic**: Allows the user to choose a Pokémon by entering a number, which retrieves the specific Pokémon from the API. A random Pokémon is selected as the opponent when the user clicks the "Novo Adversário" button.
* **Loading Indicator**: Displays a running Pokémon GIF while waiting for the API response.
* **Pokedex Display**: Shows the names and images of the first 20 Pokémon from the API.
